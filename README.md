# WebDNS

A protocol and implementation for doing DNS over HTTP. It's a work in progress. 

## WebDNS Gateway

This gateway is a DNS server and WebDNS client. It allows you to serve DNS queries via HTTP to DNS via this gateway.

## WebDNS Server

As you might expect, a WebDNS server is just a web server/application. For a reference implementation see this App Engine module: http://github.com/progrium/domdori/blob/master/dns.py
